# Styles Folder README

Welcome to the Styles folder! This folder contains all the CSS styling files for your project.

## Files

1. **colors.scss** - This file contains all the color variables used throughout the project. Defining colors as variables can help keep your code consistent and make it easier to change colors site-wide if necessary.

2. **variables.scss** - This file contains almost all the possible CSS properties with numerical values, such as margin, padding, font-size, etc. Defining these properties as variables can make your code more maintainable and save you time by reducing repetition.

3. **mixins.scss** - This file contains a few defined mixins used throughout the project. Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can help you write cleaner, more efficient CSS.

4. **fonts folder** - This folder contains any downloaded fonts used in the project. Keeping fonts in a separate folder can help keep your project organized and make it easier to manage your assets.

This is almost like our own design system.
