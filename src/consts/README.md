## Constants

This file defines the constants used throughout the app. Using constants makes it easier to manage values that are used multiple times and ensures consistency across the app.

By defining constants in a separate file, it also makes it easier to update values without having to search through the entire codebase.

In this file, you will find constants such as API endpoints and other values used throughout the app.
