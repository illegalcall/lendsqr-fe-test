## Images and Icons

This folder contains all the images and icons used throughout the app. Keeping them in a separate folder helps maintain organization and makes it easier to manage assets.

The images are stored in the <b>images</b> folder, while the icons are provided in the form of SVG files. These icons are returned from a React component, making it easier to use them within the app.

Using SVG icons provides many advantages over traditional image formats. They are vector-based, so they can be scaled without losing quality. They are also easier to manipulate and animate with CSS, providing more flexibility in designing the user interface.

This folder helps you manage and use images and icons efficiently in your project.
