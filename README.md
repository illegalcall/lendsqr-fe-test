# Project Description

This is a front-end assignment where you are required to build 4 pages - Login, Dashboard, User page, and User details page. The design for these pages can be found at [this Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/ZKILoCoIoy1IESdBpq3GNC/Frontend-Testing?node-id=5530%3A0). The user pages will pull data from a mock API with 500 records. You will also need to use local storage or indexedDB to store and retrieve user details on the user details page. The page must be mobile responsive. 

## Tech Stack

The following tech stack is required for this project:
- React with an option to use any framework you are comfortable with
- TypeScript as the language of choice
- SCSS for style processing

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to do the following:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Run the development server by running `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application

## Usage

The Login page is the starting point for the application. From there, you will be directed to the Dashboard page where you can view all the users. Clicking on a user will take you to the User details page. The user details will be stored in local storage or indexedDB, so you can retrieve them later.
